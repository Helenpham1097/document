Janina is a writer from the Philippines. She has covered a range of topics â€” from crypto and data privacy to finance and cannabis. Out of all the writing she has done, featuring MSMEs and startups is what she enjoys most. In the future, she hopes to contribute to the Philippine tech community by helping development-driven startups with their marketing and communication. During her me-time, she reads business and tech news and sometimes writes poetry, which she will never let anyone read.
