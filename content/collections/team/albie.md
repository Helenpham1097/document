Albie manages to balance his time between development and operations work at SiteHost. Most of his day is spent deep in the backend systems getting his hands dirty. Before joining SiteHost, Albie worked on many things including Internet Kiosks, SIP Servers and some Embedded Programming. When heâ€™s got time to spare he likes to listen to music and is a part time DJ.
