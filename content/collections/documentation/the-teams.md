[This beautiful diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1JGgzSdnEhyu03GPF3KGP2yy1YfKbz5g_ACNNgCpdorc) is a good place to start when trying to work out who people are, where they belong and where you can likely find them. In general, we operate a fairly flat hierarchy where we encourage people to take ownership of their roles and projects from start to finish. That being said, as we've grown there are more teams and people in charge of running those teams. You will likely report to, sit down for one-on-ones with one of the following and can raise feedback you have with:

### Management & Administration
* Nathan Russ (Managing Director)
* Quintin Russ (Technical Director)

### Operations
The Operations team is responsible for all infrastructure, customer care and support. It has two team leads who work together but focus on different areas day-to-day.
* Paulus Weingartz (Projects)
* Jishnu Ramachandran (Customer Care & Support)

### Product & Automation
This team is responsible for the majority of our customer facing products, tools and websites as well as a lot of our internal tooling. For example the Control Panel, our API, and Cloud Containers.
* Ben Lilley (Head of Product & People)

### Sales
This team primarily focuses on converting leads into customers as well as account management for our existing customer base.
* Brendan Oâ€™Ceallaigh (Sales Director)

### Marketing
This team is focused on generating new leads and customers via marketing channels such as campaigns, our websites, blog posts etc.
* Max Johns (Head of Marketing)
