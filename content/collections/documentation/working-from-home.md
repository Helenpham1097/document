To ensure we make working from home (WFH) as successful as possible it’s important we are all on the same page – from what your manager is expecting of you, to what we can expect from our colleagues in our teams. Below you will find our ~~first~~ second draft of some tips and rules around working from home, they are a good starting place but they’re likely to change as we all learn more over the coming months.

### You must have a quiet, distraction free place to work from at home.
This doesn’t mean it has to be a separate office, but you need to be able to focus, and you can’t do that if you’re being interrupted or distracted. Equally we can’t have you talking to clients on the phone or in video conferences with loud background noises, people talking to you etc.

### Ensure you have a productive and healthy workspace.
You're not going to do your best work or help your body sitting on the couch. Consider things like external displays, a high quality ergonomic chair and getting excercise as you'll probably move less when working from home. Your manager may want to see proof that you have an appropriate workspace.

### You must have a wired internet connection, VDSL or better.
Wired connections are far more stable. They make video calls/VOIP viable and you must be able to hold a reliable video call without hitching/dropping out.

### You must have a webcam, microphone and a physical VOIP phone.
Video calls become even more important when working remotely and they will be your only face-to-face option when at home. If others tell you the quality isn’t good enough when talking to you, changes need to be made. You will also need a physical VOIP phone if you’re expected to take calls regularly (Operations / Sales), if you only take them occasionally a softphone is fine.

### Confirm your plan with your manager.
If a situation comes up, say your car breaks down so you couldn’t provide notice we’ll all use our common sense, but the rule of thumb is to discuss your plan with your manager and come to an agreement. They have final say whether you can work from home – we need to consider things like productivity, needing people in the office, near data centres, or you may need to be present for a meeting etc.

### Working from home is a privilege not a right.
This flexibility requires a lot of trust from your manager and your team that you are pulling your weight and being productive. If you’re not productive at home you should be honest with yourself and not do it. If your manager feels like you’re not being productive they will work with you to solve the issue, but if it continues you will be told that you can’t work from home moving forward.

It also means that you need to be in the best location for the work you're doing. Sometimes that will mean coming into the office on a day you would prefer to work from home because your team or manager feels it's better suited for whatever you're working on. Be flexible and understanding. 

### Gather on Tuesdays
One of the benefits of having central offices is seeing people in person, being able to brainstorm together, collaborate or simply socialise. We expect we'll still be seeing each other in the office a lot but we want to ensure we retain these positives and one way we plan to do that is by having as many people together in the office as possible on Tuesdays. 

### You need to have been working here for at least three months.
While you’re going through onboarding and training you need to be in the office. These early months are where you’re going to learn the most, build trust with your team and become independent enough to work without as much support, it’s important to make the most of this time.
