This page will explain the first week for most people at SiteHost.

You may have noticed on your contract that you are technically employed by the SiteTech Group. This is our umbrella company which is currently made up of six other companies; SiteHost, WebSlice (NZ), Webslice (International), MyHost, SiteName, Chirpy. We’ll explain what they are a bit later but the main thing to understand is that we’re one team that work across all the brands. 

## Values
Company values are a tricky thing. They can very easily seem fake and hollow, but they are also important as they help us measure what we are all doing and they can help ensure that we’re all working towards common goals. These are probably overdue an update, but our values are: 

### Customers First
Everything we do should be guided by what is best for our customers. Their kind words and recommendations have helped build this business and will continue to do so. Giving them the best experience we can is our primary focus.

### Open & Honest
Be open and honest at all times. Hosting is a transaction of trust. In many cases we are literally keeping our customers business running; that trust is earned.

### Be Better
We aim to provide the best products and services we can. There are many companies that do what we do and we want to differentiate ourselves by doing it better. When it comes to our work we should go the extra mile and pay attention to the details that others will miss.
