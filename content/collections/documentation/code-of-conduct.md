In an ideal world a code of conduct wouldn’t be required, but until that world exists we need to have some basic rules and guides in place to ensure that SiteTech Group is an enjoyable place for everyone to work.

## The Short Version
Be a kind, friendly, respectful, understanding and empathetic person that values and cares for your team members and our customers.

## The Longer Version
We want SiteTech Group to be a positive and respectful place to work where you enjoy spending your working hours. To ensure that happens we need to be empathetic and respectful towards each other and own it when we make mistakes.

Treat everyone respectfully, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.

* Don’t use demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* Don’t be a bystander. Role model respectful behaviour, but also help to address disrespect when you see it.
* 
Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, listen intently, own up to your words and actions, and apologise accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them, what you learn and that you avoid repeating them in the future. 

If you experience disrespectful behavior toward yourself or anyone else and feel in any way unable or unwilling to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of any senior team member that you feel comfortable talking to. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just something that could make someone feel uncomfortable or distressed in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.
