This will outline how documentation should be written and structured.

## Key Principles

View writing internal documents as good practice for working on the customer-facing [Knowledge Base](https://kb.sitehost.nz). All written communication should represent our core values. To that end please keep the following principles in mind.

1. Before you start writing, ask yourself: What is the purpose of this article? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know? 
2. Clearly understand the topic youâ€™re writing about before you start. Get help and knowledge from other team members if necessary. You can't communicate clearly and with brevity if you don't have the topic clear in your own mind first.
3. Don't be wordy. Our customers have other things to do. They are here to get the answer to a question and move on. 
4. Tell readers what they need to know, not just what we want to say. Give them the exact information they need, along with opportunities to learn more. Don't market at them, just stay on topic and meet the objectives of the article.

## Guidelines

1. Use British English.
2. Do not use ALL CAPS because it feels like shouting.
8. Do not create links like "here" or "click here". All links should have relevant anchor text that describes what they link to, such as: "SiteHost documentation". Using meaningful links is important to both search engine crawlers (SEO) and people with accessibility issues.
9. Use [inclusive and gender-neutral language](https://techwhirl.com/gender-neutral-technical-writing/) in all writing.
10. When referring to people working for SiteHost, refer to the SiteHost team.
11. Always write SiteHost with a capitalized S and H.
12. When including SiteHost website links inside text:
   * Always use lowercase - eg. `sitehost` not `SiteHost`. 
   * Link to the `.nz` rather than `.co.nz` domain. 
   * Link to `https://` not `http://`.
   * Do not output `https://` in the visible text. 
   * For example show the link as [sitehost.nz](https://sitehost.nz) instead of [www.sitehost.nz](https://sitehost.nz) or [https://sitehost.nz](https://sitehost.nz) or [SiteHost.nz](https://sitehost.nz).
13. Always capitalise SiteHost products and features. For example "SiteHost Cloud Containers".
14. Never assume knowledge of acronyms. The first time an acronym is used (eg VPS) in an article make sure that the full title is used. For example "Virtual Private Server (VPS)".
15. When using lists, sentences should end with a full stop `.` (as this list does).
16. Even though many of our customers are technical, be wary of assuming knowledge. Within reason try to write articles as if the customer is a beginner. 
17. Provide guidance for each step. As a simple example, option 2 below is better than option 1...
  1. "Before you continue, make sure to change your IP address."
  2. "Before continuing, change your IP address by going to Settings > Manage Domain > IP Address."
18. Ensure any new article is peer reviewed and spell checked. 

## Structure

The structure of a document has a major impact on readability, searchability and linkability.

1. Large blocks of text are intimidating to the reader.
2. Clear headings allow the user to locate relevant in-page content quickly.
3. H1-H5 headings are automatically linkable and can be referenced in support emails to link customers directly to relevant content.
4. When creating lists, use [numbered lists](/everyone/guides/docs/markdown#ordered) instead of bullet lists, so points are easier to reference during a discussion.
5. Use [Notices](/everyone/guides/docs/markdown#notices) to help important points stand out clearly.
    This is an example notice.
6. You can also [Horizontal Rules](/everyone/guides/docs/markdown#horizontal-rules) to break up content.
