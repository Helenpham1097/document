        text: 'When we''re hunting around for hosting one of our primary things is support. That''s always been key. I''ve hosted with a lot of American companies, and their support is either next to none, non-existent, or handed off to a call centre that''s really not well connected to the company at all. So from my point of view, it''s peace of mind.'
