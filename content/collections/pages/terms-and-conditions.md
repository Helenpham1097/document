Should the Customer fail to do this the Customer will indemnify Webslice against any claim expense or loss suffered by the Seller as a direct or indirect consequence of such failure. No claim shall entitle the Customer to withhold payment of any sum due to Webslice under this or any other contract nor shall a claim give any right to set off any payment due to the Customer by us.'
