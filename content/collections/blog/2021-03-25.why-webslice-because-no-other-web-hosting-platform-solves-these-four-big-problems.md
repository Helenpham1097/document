But they have always had a scale problem. What would happen if you appeared on the front page of Reddit? Or you had a massive sale that drove 10x your normal numbers?'

            text: 'In many cases servers crashed, sales were lost and people were upset. As the industry and tech matured we started utilising clusters of servers behind load balancers to help with this problem, and AWS introduced auto-scaling for their EC2 VPS platform. But that still didn''t solve the problem. You had to configure your scaling, and you still had to predict large scale events (easier for things like sales than unplanned appearances on Reddit), and auto-scaling detection usually took minutes to kick in - minutes during which you still suffered from outages and lost business.'

They simply horizontally scale as far and wide as they need to, instantly. Overloading will never bring your site down, and if you go through a quiet patch your hosting resources (and your bill) can scale to zero.'

This literally renders every piece of infrastructure redundant, in the sense that the system will continue to operate just fine without it. You also need the backup pieces to automatically start working (or “failover”) whenever they’re needed. In many cases high quality system architecture requires many redundant failover systems.'

To get the benefits of serverless infrastructure without kneecapping your CMS you’d need to start again, rebuilding your entire website from scratch.'
