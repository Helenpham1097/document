That’s why we’re all familiar with caching, code optimization, and only running trusted themes and plugins. These are all important things to get right, but they are not the full performance story. The idea behind PHP Vitals is to bring web hosting into the conversation, and give developers the power to see and understand how their hosts contribute to overall WordPress speed.”'

Even at low or mid-price ranges, we’re seeing a wide range of PHP Vitals grades come through to the leaderboard. We want people to know what they’ll get before they sign up.”\_"
