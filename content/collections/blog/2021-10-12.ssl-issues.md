Issues such as performance impact due to low available memory weren’t being reflected.'

            text: 'This calculation was based on kernel memory information available in Linux, but recent updates have improved the options here. An “available” value was added to give a more accurate account of memory usage based on buffers, cache, and shared memory. That is where the increase displayed on the server resources graph comes from, meaning your servers aren''t using any more memory than before, you’re just seeing the bigger and more accurate picture.'

So we got to work planning changes to make the Cloud Container platform more secure out of the box. These plans included lengthy discussions about which configuration to deploy, how to keep customer impact minimal and what to do for anyone needing a customised configuration.'

Over a few days we then released the changes across our Cloud Container regions leaving the biggest one for last.'

            text: 'Unfortunately, upon releasing to our largest region on 25th November, we realised we had missed something, despite the planning and testing. We hadn’t tested SFTP connections from particular IDEs (like Visual Studio Code and Atom) and we quickly discovered they rely on some old cyphers. Without getting too technical our new configuration was not offering at least one Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm that they rely on, so we promptly released a patch to fix this issue.'

We should have notified all customers of the changes, explaining them in detail along with potential impacts ahead of time, with the releases happening over a scheduled maintenance window.'

It is by no means a one-size-fits-all configuration, some applications will need tighter security while some will need more flexibility to support legacy software, which is why the release also included a process to manage such customisations moving forward.'
