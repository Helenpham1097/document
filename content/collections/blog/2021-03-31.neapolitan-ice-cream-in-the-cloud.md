You’ve heard of Severless and you’ve heard of Neapolitan ice cream. But you are probably wondering how on earth the two ended up on the same page and how they are alike. Well, they aren’t, and that's exactly the point. Let us explain with a couple of stories.

## When all you want is delicious ice cream
You want ice cream. Neapolitan specifically. There’s a balance of chocolate, strawberry and vanilla that you have in mind, and you’re salivating just thinking about it.

So you go to the supermarket freezer, grab your tub but remember the one issue you have with Neapolitan ice cream. Chocolate is your all time favourite flavour, and sometimes, one tub leaves your chocolate cravings unsatisfied. You are weary of that, so you start to consider two options. 

The first option is to buy one tub. This would fit your budget nicely. It also has enough vanilla and strawberry to satisfy your cravings, but only enough chocolate for one bowl. Being a big fan of seconds, you know this often leaves you unsatisfied. 

As you can’t change the strawberry-to-vanilla-to-chocolate ratio of the tub, your second option is to purchase two tubs. 

Because you’ve been caught short on chocolate ice cream too many times before, you reluctantly but wisely decide to purchase two tubs. This costs extra and leaves you with excess strawberry ice cream. But that is the trade off you need to make to make sure your chocolate cravings are satisfied, right?!

## When all you want is web hosting that works for you
You’re an online retailer, and you’re looking at a traditional hosting service like a virtual private server (VPS) for your ecommerce site. There’s a balance of CPU, RAM and storage that you need to serve your customers quickly. You’re salivating just thinking about it. (Hey, you really like your customers, ok?)

So you find a hosting provider and see that your options include a cheaper ‘small business’ hosting package, or a larger ‘growing business’ one.


The small business package would fit the budget nicely. It also has enough CPU and RAM to accommodate your usual traffic levels and ensure optimal performance. Although, your ecommerce relies heavily on images and videos to sell products so you quickly identify an issue with storage. You’d have enough for now, but what if you extend your product list or have more customers sign up? You could run into storage issues pretty quickly. You’re weary of that.

Because of this you reluctantly, but wisely, spend the extra money on the growing business package. With double the storage capacity this ensures there is enough room to expand your range and sign up more customers. However, now you’re left with a large surplus in CPU and RAM resources - but this trade off is the only way to meet all your needs, right?

Notice a similarity? Good. 

## Is it a never ending race keeping up with changes?
You might think this the end of our story. Except the internet (and our ice cream craving) never stands still.
As an online retailer, you’ve managed to estimate your day to day resource use, but what happens in times of high traffic events, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday? 

It’s not unusual for ecommerce to see traffic increase by 3x or more over this holiday season. With this being a huge revenue opportunity, you need to ensure you can accommodate large amounts of traffic on your site and avoid running into performance issues. To ensure this, you are required to temporarily upscale your resources. Your storage needs will not change, but you now need more RAM and CPU. See the issue here? 

This time round (just like with your ice cream) you will be paying more for a bigger package that meets your RAM and CPU needs. A storage surplus is the trade off. You also now have the burden of needing to remember to scale things back in between billing cycles. 

In times of high traffic events, like Black Friday, it would be ideal to access more RAM and CPU when (and only when) it is required, without having to increase your storage capacity too. 


## Ice cream on demand
You’ve demolished your bowl of ice cream. You really want another serving of chocolate, but can’t decide if you should open the second tub. This gets you thinking - You wish there was such a thing as magical replenishing ice cream. With ice cream turning up on demand just before you dig into the container, you would never have the issue of having too much or too little of any flavour. Every bite you take would be exactly what you need, when you need it. You would never have to make a trade off again, right?

## Serverless - The magical replenishing ice cream   
Cloud computing has always been about paying for only what you use. Innovations like virtual machines and containers have gotten us closer and closer to that ideal. Serverless hosting delivers on the same promise more literally. 

When cloud services come in a fixed ratio, you still pay for all the resources reserved for your business, regardless of if you use it or not. With the ability to scale the resources your application needs when it needs it, serverless can provide multiple cost and scalability benefits. Whatever you need - storage, CPU, or RAM - turns up when you need it and disappears when you don’t.

Unlike the Neapolitan ice cream, with serverless you only pay for, and get, the exact resources your website requires at that moment in time. You can spend less time worrying about your infrastructure and have more time to focus on your customers. 

Or to put it another way, you can now eat any flavour of the Neapolitan ice cream - till your heart’s content - anytime you want, without worrying about anything running out or going to waste.

## ~~Scoop~~ Dig a little deeper
The idea of traditional hosting as neapolitan ice cream has been on our minds for a while. Quintin, our technical director, referred to it years before we launched Webslice when he laid out our plans at [WordCamp Auckland, 2019](#).
