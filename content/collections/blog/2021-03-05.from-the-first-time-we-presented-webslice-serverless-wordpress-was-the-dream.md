            text: 'As you probably already know, one thing that makes Webslice different is who we built it for. From the very start we‚Äôve embraced real world PHP websites. By building for PHP, we build for WordPress. And by building for WordPress, we build for today‚Äôs most popular CMS.'

            text: 'It wasn‚Äôt right to us that the most promising hosting technology available - serverless - couldn‚Äôt just take a WordPress site and make it go. At best there were messy deployment steps and architectural complexity, at worst an understandable belief that the easiest way to go serverless was to completely rewrite everything in a different language.'

            text: 'When we dreamed up Webslice we wanted people to just upload a WordPress site and watch it run in a serverless environment. No specialist knowledge required. If we could do that, then all the things that make nerds like me drool over serverless - lower bills, incredible scalability, and the ability to stop worrying about infrastructure - would be available to everyone. We were thinking of people who just want their webstore to get through Black Friday without slowing down, or who are starting to question why it costs a hundred bucks or more each year just to keep a blog online.'

At Auckland‚Äôs WordCamp in 2019 I looked at the current (at the time) state of serverless, the promises it held, and the reasons why those promises were hard, if not impossible, to realise without a platform like Webslice.'
