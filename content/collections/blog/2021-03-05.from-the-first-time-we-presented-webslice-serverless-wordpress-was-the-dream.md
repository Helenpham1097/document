As you probably already know, one thing that makes Webslice different is who we built it for. From the very start we’ve embraced real world PHP websites. By building for PHP, we build for WordPress. And by building for WordPress, we build for today’s most popular CMS.

It wasn’t right to us that the most promising hosting technology available - serverless - couldn’t just take a WordPress site and make it go. At best there were messy deployment steps and architectural complexity, at worst an understandable belief that the easiest way to go serverless was to completely rewrite everything in a different language.

It’s like the hosting world took one giant leap and left a lot of developers and designers behind. 

When we dreamed up Webslice we wanted people to just upload a WordPress site and watch it run in a serverless environment. No specialist knowledge required. If we could do that, then all the things that make nerds like me drool over serverless - lower bills, incredible scalability, and the ability to stop worrying about infrastructure  - would be available to everyone. We were thinking of people who just want their webstore to get through Black Friday without slowing down, or who are starting to question why it costs a hundred bucks or more each year just to keep a blog online. 

That’s why my very first public presentation about Webslice was to the WordPress community. At Auckland’s WordCamp in 2019 I looked at the current (at the time) state of serverless, the promises it held, and the reasons why those promises were hard, if not impossible, to realise without a platform like Webslice.

Writing now in 2021 as we put the finishing touches on Webslice Beta, it feels good to look back and see how far we’ve come, and how closely we’ve stuck to that original idea: that we’re opening up serverless to the world as it is, not the world as serverless purists wish it was.

## How we introduced serverless at Auckland WordCamp 2019

We weren’t shy about it: Serverless could be the future of WordPress, and I was here to show what that future could look like.


For some of the audience this was their first real look into serverless, so I ran through:
1. What “serverless” is, and where it’s come from
2. Why serverless will have a profound effect on WordPress and the WP community
3. Why we’re enabling WordPress to be deployed in serverless architectures (“...very soon”, I said at the time…)

## What serverless is, and why it is different to neapolitan ice cream

Firstly, serverless is something that does in fact involve servers. Specifically, servers that are triggered by an event. That’s why it can be called event driven computing.

These functions (or small servers) often only do one thing for a short period of time, which makes them simpler to tune. For example they might execute and render a webpage after someone types the URL into their browser.

The really neat thing about the serverless paradigm is that you can scale as high as you need but equally, you can scale to zero. This has huge benefits when it comes to costs, resilience and simplicity.

Which brings us quite naturally to neapolitan ice cream.
