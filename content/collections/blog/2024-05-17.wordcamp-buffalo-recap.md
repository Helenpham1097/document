In the Site Builders & Developers track, where I spent most of my day, you’d find cybersecurity techs and even core contributors to WordPress itself. Meanwhile, the Content Creators & Marketers track attracted people with more of a business background, or who were there because they’ve built websites to support independent projects. Everyone was welcome, and the talk schedule catered to a big range of interests and levels of expertise.'

It was interesting to see that the API enables a more app-like experience. The Block Editor isn’t exactly everyone’s favorite thing, but this sort of capability makes it more appealing.
