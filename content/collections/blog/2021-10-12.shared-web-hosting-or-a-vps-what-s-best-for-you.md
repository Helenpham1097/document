Think of it like this: more CPU cores let your server multitask, and more RAM lets it do those tasks faster. If your site gets busy enough to overload either your CPU or RAM, page load times will get longer, and eventually your site will crash.'

You don’t want your VPS sitting inside a years-old box that was built back when 4G phones were the latest thing. Ask about the hardware that providers offer. See if anyone else can match the NVMe storage that we put all our new customers on."
